# Modules and Packages

# PyPI is a repository for open-source 3rd party packages
# It's similar to RubyGems in the Ruby world, PHP's Packageist,CPAN and Perl, and NPM for Node.js.
# So far we've really only used libraries that come internally with Python.
# There are many other libraries available that people have open-sourced and shared on PyPi.
# We can use "pip install" in the command line to install there packages.
# By installing Python from python.org or through the Anaconda distribution you also installed pip
# pip is a simple way to download packages at your command line directly from the PyPi repository. -->
